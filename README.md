## Data Source
 The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Financial_CSV.Csv"  containing detailed information on income and expenses of an individual

## Saving Rate Model
``` Excel
Monthly savings/Monthly income * 100
```
## Tools
 Excel  - Data cleaning, analysis and visualization

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Data loading and Inspection
- Handling missing values
- creating Month name, month number, and net income using excel functions

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Why was the net income declining after the month of January?
- How can a fixed range of amount be saved monthly?
-  Which month had the highest income or expenses and why?
- What is the net income after all expenses and is it recommended to maintain such net income?

## Analysis
- Excel pivot tables were used for this analysis

## Insights & Visualization
- The individual in the month of January had 3 different sources of income, thereby boasting the saving rate to about 79% .  Meanwhile, only two sources of income was seen in the rest  of the  months. Hence leading to declined in net income
- From the analysis, the month of January had the highest income while the month of May had the highest expenses
- The net income after all expenses as shown in the dashboard is $35, 249, and the analysis revealed a dropped in quality of content shared on YouTube from the month of February, as well as inconsistency.
